# MARIO (Minimal Articulated Robotic Intelligent Object) ‚Äì Non-ROS Implementation

This project is a minimal version of [MARIO](https://github.com/SRA-VJTI/MARIO), a low-cost 3 DoF robotic arm developed by SRA-VJTI. The original version is built on ROS, we ditch ROS entirely and go straight to controlling the robot using an ESP32 over serial and HTTP/WebSocket.

The goal was to make MARIO easier to run and test, especially for setups where ROS might be overkill or unavailable.

## What This Project Does

- Accepts input over serial to control MARIO
- Supports:
    * Direct joint angle control
    * Inverse kinematics from XYZ coordinates
    * Web interface control via HTTP and WebSocket
- Uses ESP32-WROOM-32E as the main controller
- Can be compiled with ESP-IDF or tested quickly through the Arduino IDE and serial monitor

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32-WROOM-DA module
- MARIO robotic arm (or any compatible 5 DoF robotic arm)
- USB cable to connect to a PC

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Alternatively: ESP-IDF v4.1.0 or later
- Serial Monitor (115200 baud rate)
- Correct board selected: `ESP32 WROOM DA Module`
- Correct COM port selected

## How to Use It

### Make changes in the CMakeList.txt
- Change the idf_component_register(SRCS "web_socket_control.c" 
  according to which c file you wanna run and flash

### Using Arduino IDE

1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Select `ESP32 WROOM DA Module` as the board
3. Choose the correct COM port
4. Set baud rate to `115200`
5. Upload one of the source files
6. Open the Serial Monitor

### Providing Input

Depending on the uploaded script, you can either send direct joint angles or XYZ coordinates:

#### Input Angles (`input_angles.c`)

Enter space-separated joint angles like:
30 60 90 20

Each number corresponds to the desired angle (in degrees) for a specific servo. The arm will move accordingly.

#### Input Coordinates (`input_coordiantes.c`)

Enter space-separated XYZ coordinates like:
12 25 7


The onboard inverse kinematics algorithm (`inverseKinematics.c`) will convert these coordinates into joint angles and move the arm.

# Web Control (New!)
 web_control.c + web_socket_control.c

Run a web server directly on ESP32:

  * Control each servo via a clean HTML UI

  * Uses both HTTP and WebSocket for snappy updates and bi-directional control

Access via browser at ESP32's IP (shown in serial logs).

## File Overview

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `input_angles.c` | Accepts direct angle input from serial |
| `input_coordiantes.c` | Accepts (x, y, z) and uses IK to compute angles |
| `inverseKinematics.c` | Contains the inverse kinematics logic |
| `sweep_motion.c` | Sweeps the joints to test motion |
| `web_socket_control.c` | Real-time control via WebSocket |
| `CMakeLists.txt` | Build instructions for ESP-IDF |
| `idf_component.yml` | Component manifest for ESP-IDF |

## Notes

- This version was built to simplify testing and control of the MARIO arm without setting up ROS.
- The Arduino Serial Monitor is sufficient for basic testing and input.
- You can also build and flash the code using ESP-IDF for more complex setups.

## Credits

This work is based on [MARIO by SRA-VJTI](https://github.com/SRA-VJTI/MARIO) and reimplemented to make it lighter, easier to run, and more accessible for basic use cases or hardware testing without ROS.

---

If you plan to expand this, add GUI control or a web socket, or reintroduce ROS later, this version can serve as a solid base to build from.
